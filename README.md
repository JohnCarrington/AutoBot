# AutoBot

An automated trading bot for GBPUSD on an IG **demo** account. It reads live prices, works out the market state, lets only the right strategies look for trades, checks every trade idea against safety rules, and sends orders to IG with a stop loss and take profit. Every trade is recorded, shown on a dashboard and reported by Telegram.

**Current stage:** empty project. There is no trading code and no connection to IG yet. Only the settings and their tests exist.

## Where things are

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: the parts of the bot and how they connect
- `docs/SETTINGS.md`: every setting, what it does, and its value
- `config/settings.toml`: the settings file (all numbers live here)
- `.env.example`: the secret settings the bot will need later (copy to `.env`; never commit `.env`)
- `tests/technical/` and `tests/functional/`: the tests

## Setting up

```
cd /opt/autobot
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
git config core.hooksPath hooks     # turns on the pre-commit test check
```

## Running the tests

One command runs every test:

```
./run_tests.sh
```

Every commit runs all the tests first (`hooks/pre-commit`). If any test fails, the commit is blocked.

## Checking the settings file

```
.venv/bin/python -m config
```

This prints every setting, or stops with a message saying which setting is missing or wrong.
